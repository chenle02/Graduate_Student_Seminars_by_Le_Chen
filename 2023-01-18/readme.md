# Title: `Introduction to Stochastic Heat Equation`
# Abstract:
```

In this talk, I will delve into the intricacies of the stochastic heat equation
(SHE), a mathematical model that captures the delicate balance between the
smoothing effect of the Laplacian and the roughening effect of multiplicative
noise. The interplay of these opposing forces can be observed in a wide range of
natural phenomena. Gaining a deeper understanding of the SHE is crucial as it
serves as a stepping stone to unlock the mysteries of many more complex systems.
