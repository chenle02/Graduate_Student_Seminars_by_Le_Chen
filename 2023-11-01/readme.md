Disorderly surface growth

```
# Abstract:
```

 In this talk, we will introduce the surface growth phenomenon in a disorderded
 system. Examples include the wetting, burning, and rupture of paper, the
 accumulations of snow flakes, as well as the growths of crystal and tumor.
 Despite the apparent diversity in these processes, their surface fluctuations
 exhibit some universal characteristics. Stochastic partial differential
 equations (SPDEs), in particular, the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, are
 the main mathematical tool to capture these universal features, which then
 provide the univsersality classes that go beyond the central limit theorem. The
 significance of this field of research is underscored by the prestigious
 accolades awarded to its pioneers, including Giorgio Parisi (the Nobel Prize in
 Physics in 2021) and Martin Hairer (the Fields Medal in 2014), among many
 others. This talk aims to serve as both an overview of SPDEs in the context of
 disordered surface growth and as a source of inspiration for students
 considering a Ph.D. in this exciting field. The main reference of this talk is
 the book by two physicists Barab√°si and Stanley, ''Fractal Concepts in Surface
 Growth'', Combridge University Press, 1995.
